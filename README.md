This web application will be your go-to platform for generating logical puzzles for problem-solving. My aim is to create images that not only serve as puzzles but also convey meaningful representations once they are solved.

## Key Features To Implement:
üñºÔ∏è **Puzzle Generation and Solving:** Generate puzzles and solve them directly on the platform to sharpen your logical thinking skills.

üîç **Hint Assistance:** Stuck on a puzzle? Request a hint to nudge you in the right direction.

üèÜ **Hall of Fame:** Explore a showcase of solved challenges and celebrate your achievements.

üì∏ **Upload Your Puzzles:** Upload images of physical logic puzzles, whether it's a snapshot of a paper puzzle or a hand-drawn challenge. Seek hints or complete solutions along with detailed analyses.


### Current Solutions:
Currently available **websites** that delve into the topic of logic puzzles typically don't limit themselves to just nonograms. You can find many other types of logic puzzles there. Below are examples of such websites:

* [Picross Nonogram](https://www.puzzle-nonograms.com/): This is a popular online tool for solving logic puzzles, including nonograms.

* [Griddlers Plus](https://www.griddlers.net/): Another website offering a wide selection of logic puzzles to solve online.

* [Janko At WarpZone](http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/): This Anglo-German website contains a collection of logic puzzles, including nonograms, griddlers, and others, which can be printed or solved online.

However, **mobile applications** are more narrowly dedicated to one type of puzzle. For example, [Nonogram.com - ≈Åamig≈Ç√≥wki](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybrain.nonogram&hl=pl&gl=US)  has a rating of 4.1 and 50 million downloads. A downside in this category of solutions is often the advertisements, which can disrupt the solving of puzzles.
